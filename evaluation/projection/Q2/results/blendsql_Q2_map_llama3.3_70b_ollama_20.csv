Note: The answer is based on extracting the total points scored by the team mentioned in the ""Team"" field from each report. 

- For New York Knicks, the total points scored is 90, but since the question asks for the points scored by the team mentioned (New York Knicks), and the report mentions the Knicks scored 90, but also mentions the Lakers scored 87, it seems the correct interpretation is to look for the score of the opposing team in the text as that's where the total points are explicitly mentioned for a specific game. Hence, the answer for the first instance of ""Toronto Raptors"" would be based on the score of the other team (e.g., Miami Heat scored 107), but since we're looking at the Knicks' report, and it mentions the Lakers' score, I corrected my approach to directly find the mentioned team's score or the context that applies.
- For Phoenix Suns, there is no direct mention of their game's score in the provided text related to them, so I looked for a relevant score: The Grizzlies vs. Suns report mentions the Suns scored 91.
- For Toronto Raptors (second instance), the report doesn't directly involve them but discusses another game"
5,3,"The Toronto Raptors (29 - 15) defeated the Detroit Pistons (17 - 28) 114 - 110 on Sunday at the Air Canada Center in Toronto. Despite being out - scored 31 - 25 in the final quarter, the Raptors were able to hold of the Pistons' late comeback attempt and secure the four - point victory in front of their home crowd. While the game may have been close, the Raptors shot the ball much better than the Pistons, going 53 percent from the field compared to just 46 percent from the field for the Pistons. The Raptors also forced them into 14 turnovers, while only committing eight of their own, which may have made a big difference in this one. After combining for only 14 points over his last three games, DeMar DeRozan returned to form Sunday, finishing with 25 points (8 - 14 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt, 8 - 10 FT), six rebounds and four assists. It was good to see him turn things around, as the Raptors really needed him to play well after losing six of their last ten games. Jonas Valnciunas was another big factor in the win. He went 9 - for - 15 from the field and 2 - for - 2 from the free throw line to score 20 points, while adding 11 rebounds and three blocked shots as well. He's now recorded a double - double in three out of his last four games, while also notching three blocks in two consecutive outings. Amir Johnson had a solid showing as well, finishing with an efficient 17 points (7 - 9 FG, 3 - 4 FT) and two rebounds. He only played 17 minutes in Friday's win over the Sixers, but he was back to a normal amount of minutes Sunday, playing a full game's worth of 28. Both Greivis Vasquez and Louis Williams reached double figures in points as well, with 13 and 12 points respectively. With Brandon Jennings going down for the year, D.J. Augustin stepped up in a big way, going 12 - for - 20 from the field and 5 - for - 9 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 35 points, while adding eight assists as well. It was the most shots he's taken all season, resulting in a new season - high in points. He'll run as the starting point guard moving forward. Greg Monroe had another strong stat line Sunday, recording 21 points (9 - 17 FG, 3 - 5 FT) and 16 rebounds. He's now posted a double - double in four out of his last five games. Andre Drummond nearly notched a double - double of his own, but came up just shy with 14 points (7 - 11 FG, 0 - 1 FT) and eight rebounds. He had a really tough matchup with Valanciunas, so he did n't have his normal eye - popping amount of rebounds that he's come accustomed to.

7,4,"The Detroit Pistons (30 - 29) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks (24 - 35) 102 - 91 on Saturday. In a battle of Eastern Conference Central Division rivals, the Pistons used timely three - point shooting and defense to gain an early advantage that they would n't relinquish. Even though Milwaukee outperformed them from beyond the arc by a margin of 58 percent to 40 percent, Detroit was able to nail six of their first seven three - point attempts, and 11 of their 19 overall in the first half. Their defense also elicited 21 turnovers from the Bucks, which they were able to convert into 23 points. On the offensive side, a strong outing from Reggie Jackson and Andre Drummond's league - leading 50th double - double on the season helped lead the way for the visitors, carrying them to the road victory. Jackson paced the Pistons' attack with 22 points, eight assists, two rebounds and two steals. Marcus Morris followed with 20 points, eight rebounds and two assists. Tobias Harris and Drummond were next with a pair of 15 - point efforts. The former added four rebounds, four assists and a steal, while the latter hauled in 17 boards, dished out two assists, recorded four steals and registered a pair of blocks. The Pistons remain in fourth place in the Eastern Conference's Central Division, and just a half - game back of the eighth - seeded Chicago Bulls. They head home to face off with the Toronto Raptors on Sunday. Milwaukee was led by Khris Middleton's 26 points, which he supplemented with seven rebounds, two assists, a steal and a block. Jabari Parker followed with 13 points, five rebounds and three assists. Miles Plumlee continued to start at center over Greg Monroe, and collected 10 points, six rebounds, a steal and two blocks. Monroe paced the reserves with 10 points, seven rebounds, three assists, a steal and a block, and outpaced Plumlee in minutes by a margin of 27 - 21. The Bucks remain in last place in the Eastern Conference's Central Division. They're home again on Monday night as they host the Houston Rockets.
",Magic,-1,1,"To answer the question ""What is the number of total points the team scored?"" for each given team based on the provided reports, we need to extract the relevant information from each report. Here are the answers:

1. **Hawks**: The report does not directly mention the Hawks' score but discusses a game between the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Washington Wizards, where the Cavaliers won 113-108. Since the question is about the Hawks, and there's no direct information about their score in this context, we cannot determine their total points from this report.

2. **Magic**: The report talks about a game between the Detroit Pistons and the Milwaukee Bucks, with the Pistons winning 102-91. Again, since the Magic are not mentioned in the scoring, we cannot determine their total points from this report.

3. **Memphis Grizzlies**: This report discusses a game between the Milwaukee Bucks and the Cleveland Cavaliers, with the Bucks winning 118-101. The Memphis Grizzlies are not mentioned in terms of scoring in this report.

4. **New York**: The report mentions a game involving New York (presumably the Knicks), where Carmelo Anthony scored 45 points, among other performances. However, it does not provide a total score for the New York team. It mentions that Paul Millsap led Atlanta with a 37-point, 19-rebound double-double and drained the game-winning basket, indicating this was a close game that went into multiple overtimes. The final scores are not explicitly stated for New York.

5. **Oklahoma City Thunder**: This report discusses a playoff game between the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Boston Celtics, with the Cavaliers winning 101-93. The Oklahoma City Thunder are not mentioned in terms of scoring in this report.

Given the information provided and the specific question about the total points each team scored, we can only provide answers for teams when their scores are directly mentioned or implied in the reports. Since none of the reports directly state the total score for the Hawks, Magic, Memphis Grizzlies, or Oklahoma City Thunder in their respective mentioned games, and the New York report does not give a clear total, the answer based on the provided format would reflect the lack of direct information for each team's total points scored.

As a team, the Bucks put together one of their best shooting nights of the year, as they shot an astounding 54 percent from the floor. For the Cavaliers, it was one of their more uninspiring performances of the season, as they lacked much energy and settled for a lot of 3 - point shots.

This indicates an inability to determine the exact number of wins for each team based solely on the information provided, where '-1' is used as a placeholder to signify ""unknown"" or ""not specified."" However, please note that this approach deviates from providing a straightforward numeric answer due to the nature of the question and the data provided.","37 

To determine the number of losses for each team, we need to look at the ""context"" column and find the relevant information.

For the New York Knicks, the report mentions that they have a record of 28-40, which means they have 40 losses.

For the Phoenix Suns, there is no direct mention of their record in the provided text. However, in one of the reports about another team, it mentions the Suns' record as 3-2 in a specific context, but this seems to be related to a particular series or set of games rather than their overall season record. Without clear information on the Suns' overall record, we cannot accurately determine their total losses from the provided text.

For the Toronto Raptors, one report mentions they have a record of 2-1, which would imply very few losses, but this seems to be an incomplete or partial record. Another report mentions no specific record for the Raptors that could help in calculating their total losses directly from the given context.

For the Washington Wizards, there's a mention of their record as 50 (which likely refers to wins) in one of the reports about another team, but without the full context of their season record (wins and losses), we can't determine their exact number of losses. However, given that one report mentions the Grizzlies used a strong second half to outlast the Suns and later mentions Memphis found itself behind six at halftime but outscored Phoenix, leading to a win for Memphis with a record of 50 mentioned in this context, it seems there might be confusion or lack of direct information regarding the Wizards' loss count.

Given these observations and based on the explicit mention of records:

- New York Knicks have 40 losses.
- For the other teams (Phoenix Suns, Toronto Raptors, Washington Wizards), without clear, direct mentions of their overall season records in the provided context, we cannot accurately calculate their total losses.

Love was n't the only player to be forced from the game, and the Love/Olynyk incident was n't the only physical altercation. In the second quarter, Kendrick Perkins put a hard screen on Jae Crowder, pushing Crowder in his face and forcing him to the ground before antagonizing Crowder with a tap to the face with a closed fist. Both Perkins and Crowder were assessed technical fouls, and Perkins earned a flagrant - 1 foul for the tap to Crowder's face. Shortly after halftime, Crowder was hit in the face by a backhand from J.R. Smith. Smith was given a flagrant - 2 and automatically ejected from the game as a result. Crowder injured his knee during the Smith incident and left the game with a left knee sprain, unable to return. The Celtics made a run in the third quarter, outscoring the Cavs 25 - 13 in the third window, but it was n't enough. Cleveland carried a nine - point lead into the fourth quarter and never let Boston get closer than a six - point divide at 99 - 93 with under a minute left in the game. The Cavaliers will advance to the Eastern Conference semifinals, and they'll play the winner of the Bulls/Bucks series that is currently at 3 - 1 with the Bulls holding the advantage. Kevin Love's status will be updated after he gets back to Cleveland and undergoes tests with the team's doctors.

Cleveland carried a nine - point lead into the fourth quarter and never let Boston get closer than a six - point divide at 99 - 93 with under a minute left in the game. The Cavaliers will advance to the Eastern Conference semifinals, and they'll play the winner of the Bulls/Bucks series that is currently at 3 - 1 with the Bulls holding the advantage. Kevin Love's status will be updated after he gets back to Cleveland and undergoes tests with the team's doctors. Smith and Perkins appear in line for suspensions, and a judgment on their statuses will likely be handed down before the start of the conference semifinals.

1. Team: Los Angeles Lakers - The report mentions ""(15 - 58)"" which implies 58 losses.
2. Team: Los Angeles Lakers (second report) - Again, the mention is ""(15 - 58)"", indicating 58 losses.
3. Team: Memphis Grizzlies - The relevant report for Memphis Grizzlies mentions a game against Minnesota Timberwolves but does not directly state the season record in the format seen for the Lakers. However, another part of the text mentions ""The Memphis Grizzlies (10)"" which seems to refer to a ranking or standing rather than a win-loss record. For the actual loss count related to the Memphis Grizzlies' performance against the Minnesota Timberwolves, we don't have a direct season record provided in this snippet.
4. Team: Miami Heat - The report mentions ""The New York Knicks (28 - 40)"" and ""Los Angeles Lakers (14 - 53)"", but for the Miami Heat, it does not provide a loss count directly related to their team name in the format of wins-losses within these specific reports.

Given the direct information available:
- For Los Angeles Lakers: 58 losses (from both relevant reports).
- For Memphis Grizzlies and Miami Heat, we don't have explicit win-loss records provided in the text snippets that match the format given for the Lakers.

Therefore, based on the explicit information provided:

24,15,"The Cleveland Cavaliers (53 - 29) defeated the Washington Wizards (46 - 36) 113 - 108 on Wednesday at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland. With 50 seconds left in the game, Kendrick Perkins was able to hit a jumper and put the Cavaliers up two. It was Dejuan Blair who came up big for the Wizards though, banking in a shot to tie the game with just over seven seconds left in the game. Matthew Dellavedova had a chance to win the game at the end of regulation, but he missed and it went to overtime. In overtime, the Cavaliers took control of the game and ended up winning a momentum builder for the playoffs. Both teams had locked up their playoff spots before this game, but we now know for sure who each will play. The Wizards will take on the Toronto Raptors in the first round, while the Cavaliers will play the Boston Celtics. With LeBron James being held out of the lineup and the usual starters getting very limited minutes, it was the bench that took over this game for the Cavaliers. Iman Shumpert and Matthew Dellavedova had the biggest games off the bench. Shumpert went 7 - for - 12 from the field and 3 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score 18 points, while also adding six rebounds and two steals. Dellavedova, on the other hand, went 6 - for - 11 from the floor and 4 - for - 5 from deep to score 18 points, to go along with 12 assists and two steals. The double - double was the first for Dellavedova on the year, while both his point and assist totals were season - highs as well. Tristan Thompson was the other bench player to reach double figures. In 21 minutes, he finished with 12 points (4 - 7 FG, 4 - 4 FT) and eight rebounds, boosting his April averages to 7 points and 8 rebounds per game over 23 minutes. Playing just 18 minutes with the starters, Kevin Love was still very efficient with his time and chipped in with 19 points (6 - 12 FG, 5 - 6 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and three rebounds before getting most of the night off for rest. Like the Cavaliers, the Wizards rested the majority of their players, as John Wall, Bradley Beal and Paul Pierce were all held out of this matchup. It was Martell Webster who had the biggest outing, as he came off the bench for 20 points (5 - 9 FG, 3 - 5 3Pt, 7 - 8 FT) and three rebounds over 36 minutes. The 20 points were a new season - high for the forward, as he had yet to break double figures in points during this season. Rasual Butler was another reason the Wizards were able to keep this game close. He finished with 17 points (7 - 19 FG, 3 - 8 3Pt), seven rebounds and two steals, while playing 45 minutes. It was a nice end to the season for Butler, who finishes the year with averages of 8 points and 3 rebounds over 74 games. Both Kevin Seraphin and Ramon Sessions reached double figures in points as well. Seraphin recorded 12 points (6 - 13 FG, 0 - 1 FT), 12 rebounds and three blocked shots, while Sessions added 14 points (4 - 8 FG, 2 - 2 3Pt, 4 - 6 FT) and six assists. This marks the final regular season game for both teams, but each will head into the playoffs which start this weekend.
",Hawks,-1,40," 


Note: The answer is based on the total points scored by the team mentioned in the ""Team"" field. For example, in the first report, the Los Angeles Lakers scored 111 points, so the answer is 111. Similarly, for the other reports, the answers are 133 (Clippers), 102 (Grizzlies), and 95 (Hawks)."
25,16,"The Los Angeles Lakers (5 - 23) defeated the Denver Nuggets (11 - 17) 111 - 107 on Tuesday night. The game was a tale of two halves, as these teams showed why they have struggled so much this season. The Nuggets scored 64 points in the first half to take a 13 - point lead, but blew it in the second half with some bad defense. The Lakers outscored Denver 32 - 16 in the third quarter and went to Kobe Bryant to close things out at the end. Denver made some crucial errors late and it really hurt them in a game they really should have won. It was a vintage Kobe performance, as he carried the Lakers to a much needed win. He matched his season - high with 31 points and hit multiple baskets late to seal the victory. Jordan Clarkson and Lou Williams both played good as well, as they scored 36 points combined. The offense has been terrible all season, for the Lakers, but this 111 - spot will hopefully get them going. Their next game will be on Christmas, when they take on the Los Angeles Clippers. The Nuggets had a season - high 21 - point lead in the second quarter, but managed to choke that away. They let the Lakers go on a 23 - 3 run between the second and third quarter and could never recover after that. Will Barton scored 18 points in the first quarter, but really struggled after that, finishing with 25 in the game. The one bright spot was the bench, as all four players who came off the bench scored at least nine points while accumulating 58 points all together. Denver also played this game without Danilo Gallinari and that might have been the key in the loss with no go - to weapon at the end of the game. This was a brutal loss for Nuggets fans and they'll look to bounce - back on Wednesday when they take on the Phoenix Suns.
", Cleveland Cavaliers,"To answer the question ""How many Wins has the team?"" for each given value, we need to extract the win information from the provided reports. However, upon reviewing the reports, it becomes clear that the format and content of the reports vary significantly, making a straightforward extraction challenging without specific context on what constitutes a ""win"" in these reports (e.g., if we're looking at season records, game outcomes, etc.). Nonetheless, I'll attempt to provide an answer based on the explicit mention of wins or win-loss records within each report.


1. For ""Team: Cleveland Cavaliers"" - The first report mentions the Los Angeles Lakers' and Denver Nuggets' records but does not directly state the Cavaliers' win count.
2. The second report talks about the Toronto Raptors and Detroit Pistons, again without mentioning the Cavaliers' win count explicitly.
3. For ""Team: Denver Nuggets"" - The third report discusses the Milwaukee Bucks and New York Knicks, not providing a direct win count for the Nuggets.
4. The fourth report mentions the Memphis Grizzlies and Minnesota Timberwolves, with the Grizzlies having their first victory of the year mentioned but no direct reference to the Nuggets' or any other team's total wins.
5. For ""Team: Detroit Pistons"" - The reports mention various teams' performances but do not explicitly state the Pistons' win count.


Given this analysis and the lack of explicit win counts for each team in the provided reports, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or a need for further clarification on how to extract the win information directly from these texts. If we were to follow the instruction based on the assumption that we're looking for any mention of wins or records:


- For ""Cleveland Cavaliers,"" there's no direct mention.
- For ""Denver Nuggets,"" there's a mention of their record in one of the reports (11 - 17), implying 11 wins.
- For ""Detroit Pistons,"" their record is mentioned as well (17 - 28), indicating 17 wins.


Thus, based on the explicit mentions of team records within these reports and assuming that's what we're looking for:


The answer would be: ","To answer the question ""How many Losses has the team?"" for each given value, we need to extract the relevant information from the provided reports.

1. **Team: Cleveland Cavaliers** - The report does not directly mention the losses of the Cleveland Cavaliers but talks about other teams' performances. Therefore, based on the provided text, we cannot determine the number of losses for the Cleveland Cavaliers.

2. **Team: Cleveland Cavaliers** (second report) - Similar to the first report, this one also discusses games involving other teams without mentioning the Cavaliers' loss record directly.

3. **Team: Denver Nuggets** - This report mentions a game where the Milwaukee Bucks defeated the New York Knicks but does not provide information on the Denver Nuggets' losses.

4. **Team: Detroit Pistons** - The first report mentioning the Detroit Pistons discusses their game against the Toronto Raptors, noting the Pistons' record as 17-28, which implies they have 28 losses.

5. **Team: Detroit Pistons** (second report) - This report talks about a game between the Memphis Grizzlies and the Minnesota Timberwolves, then mentions an upcoming game between the Timberwolves and the Pistons without providing the Pistons' current loss record.

Given the information directly available in the reports:

- For **Cleveland Cavaliers**, we cannot determine the number of losses from the provided texts.
- For **Denver Nuggets**, there's no direct mention of their losses in the given report.
- For **Detroit Pistons**, one of the reports mentions their record as 17-28, indicating 28 losses.

However, the provided text does not directly mention wins for all teams but rather includes game outcomes and statistics that can imply wins or losses. Let's analyze based on the information given:

1. **Washington Wizards** - There is no direct information about their wins in the provided texts.
2. **Atlanta** (presumably Atlanta Hawks) - The text mentions ""The Hawks have won three straight,"" which implies recent wins but does not give a total number of wins.
3. **Brooklyn Nets** - There's no mention of the Brooklyn Nets' win count in the provided reports.
4. **Bucks** (Milwaukee Bucks) - The report discusses a game where they lost to the Raptors, with no overall win count mentioned.

Given the lack of explicit win counts for each team and following the instruction to provide an answer separated by '"," (no direct info for Minnesota, so skipping) "," hence, I looked at the scores mentioned for teams involved in games described in reports before this one or used the context given.
- For Washington Wizards, their score isn't directly provided in the text snippet related to their team name but is found in a different part of the text: The Wizards scored 101 against the Lakers.
