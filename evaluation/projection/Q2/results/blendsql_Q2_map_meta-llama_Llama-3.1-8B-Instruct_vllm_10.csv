1,1,"The Milwaukee Bucks (18 - 17) defeated the New York Knicks (5 - 31) 95 - 82 on Sunday at Madison Square Garden in New York. The Bucks were able to have a great night defensively, giving themselves the scoring advantage in all four quarters. The Bucks showed superior shooting, going 46 percent from the field, while the Knicks went only 41 percent from the floor. The Bucks also out - rebounded the Knicks 48 - 36, giving them in an even further advantage which helped them secure the 13 - point victory on the road. Brandon Knight led the Bucks again in this one. He went 6 - for - 14 from the field and 1 - for - 3 from beyond the arc to score 17 points, while also handing out five assists. He's now averaging 21 points per game over his last three games, as he's consistently been the offensive leader for this team. Zaza Pachulia also had a strong showing, finishing with 16 points (6 - 12 FG, 4 - 4 FT) and a team - high of 14 rebounds. It marked his second double - double in a row and fourth on the season, as the inexperienced centers on the Knicks' roster were n't able to limit him. Notching a double - double of his own, Giannis Antetokounmpo recorded 16 points (6 - 9 FG, 1 - 1 3Pt, 3 - 6 FT) and 12 rebounds. The 12 rebounds matched a season - high, while it was his second double - double of the season. Coming off the bench for a big night was Kendall Marshall. He went 6 - for - 8 from the field and 3 - for - 3 from the free throw line to score 15 points in 20 minutes. The Knicks really struggled to score without Carmelo Anthony and Amare Stoudemire. Tim Hardaway Jr led the team as the starting shooting guard, going 6 - for - 13 from the field and 3 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score 17 points, while also adding four assists. He's now scored 17 or more points in three out of his last four games, as he has put it on himself to pick up the slack with other key players sitting out. J.R. Smith also put together a solid outing as a starter. He finished with 15 points and seven rebounds in 37 minutes. Like Haradaway Jr, he's also benefitted from other guys sitting out, and has now combined for 37 points over his last two games. While he did n't have his best night defensively, Cole Aldrich scored 12 points (6 - 10 FG) and grabbed seven rebounds in 19 minutes. The only other Knick to reach double figures in points was Jason Smith, who came off the bench for 10 points (3 - 11 FG, 4 - 4 FT).

3,3,"The Toronto Raptors (29 - 15) defeated the Detroit Pistons (17 - 28) 114 - 110 on Sunday at the Air Canada Center in Toronto. Despite being out - scored 31 - 25 in the final quarter, the Raptors were able to hold of the Pistons' late comeback attempt and secure the four - point victory in front of their home crowd. While the game may have been close, the Raptors shot the ball much better than the Pistons, going 53 percent from the field compared to just 46 percent from the field for the Pistons. The Raptors also forced them into 14 turnovers, while only committing eight of their own, which may have made a big difference in this one. After combining for only 14 points over his last three games, DeMar DeRozan returned to form Sunday, finishing with 25 points (8 - 14 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt, 8 - 10 FT), six rebounds and four assists. It was good to see him turn things around, as the Raptors really needed him to play well after losing six of their last ten games. Jonas Valnciunas was another big factor in the win. He went 9 - for - 15 from the field and 2 - for - 2 from the free throw line to score 20 points, while adding 11 rebounds and three blocked shots as well. He's now recorded a double - double in three out of his last four games, while also notching three blocks in two consecutive outings. Amir Johnson had a solid showing as well, finishing with an efficient 17 points (7 - 9 FG, 3 - 4 FT) and two rebounds. He only played 17 minutes in Friday's win over the Sixers, but he was back to a normal amount of minutes Sunday, playing a full game's worth of 28. Both Greivis Vasquez and Louis Williams reached double figures in points as well, with 13 and 12 points respectively. With Brandon Jennings going down for the year, D.J. Augustin stepped up in a big way, going 12 - for - 20 from the field and 5 - for - 9 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 35 points, while adding eight assists as well. It was the most shots he's taken all season, resulting in a new season - high in points. He'll run as the starting point guard moving forward. Greg Monroe had another strong stat line Sunday, recording 21 points (9 - 17 FG, 3 - 5 FT) and 16 rebounds. He's now posted a double - double in four out of his last five games. Andre Drummond nearly notched a double - double of his own, but came up just shy with 14 points (7 - 11 FG, 0 - 1 FT) and eight rebounds. He had a really tough matchup with Valanciunas, so he did n't have his normal eye - popping amount of rebounds that he's come accustomed to. The only other Piston to reach double figures in points was Kentavious Caldwell-Pope who added 16 points (6 - 17 FG, 3 - 9 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT), three rebounds and two steals. The Raptors' next game will be on the road against the Indiana Pacers on Tuesday, while the Pistons will be at home against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Tuesday.

4,4,"The Detroit Pistons (30 - 29) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks (24 - 35) 102 - 91 on Saturday. In a battle of Eastern Conference Central Division rivals, the Pistons used timely three - point shooting and defense to gain an early advantage that they would n't relinquish. Even though Milwaukee outperformed them from beyond the arc by a margin of 58 percent to 40 percent, Detroit was able to nail six of their first seven three - point attempts, and 11 of their 19 overall in the first half. Their defense also elicited 21 turnovers from the Bucks, which they were able to convert into 23 points. On the offensive side, a strong outing from Reggie Jackson and Andre Drummond's league - leading 50th double - double on the season helped lead the way for the visitors, carrying them to the road victory. Jackson paced the Pistons' attack with 22 points, eight assists, two rebounds and two steals. Marcus Morris followed with 20 points, eight rebounds and two assists. Tobias Harris and Drummond were next with a pair of 15 - point efforts. The former added four rebounds, four assists and a steal, while the latter hauled in 17 boards, dished out two assists, recorded four steals and registered a pair of blocks. The Pistons remain in fourth place in the Eastern Conference's Central Division, and just a half - game back of the eighth - seeded Chicago Bulls. They head home to face off with the Toronto Raptors on Sunday. Milwaukee was led by Khris Middleton's 26 points, which he supplemented with seven rebounds, two assists, a steal and a block. Jabari Parker followed with 13 points, five rebounds and three assists. Miles Plumlee continued to start at center over Greg Monroe, and collected 10 points, six rebounds, a steal and two blocks. Monroe paced the reserves with 10 points, seven rebounds, three assists, a steal and a block, and outpaced Plumlee in minutes by a margin of 27 - 21. The Bucks remain in last place in the Eastern Conference's Central Division. They're home again on Monday night as they host the Houston Rockets.

5,5,"The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 118 - 101 Tuesday at BMO Harris Bradley Center. The Bucks (8 - 8) took advantage of a Cavaliers (13 - 3) team that looked disinterested from the second quarter on, as Milwaukee managed to open up a four - point lead at halftime and won the game with the help of a dominant third quarter, which they won 34 - 20. It got so out of hand in the third period that Cleveland head coach Tyronn Lue pulled all five of his starters who were on the court. The Bucks were led by Giannis Antetokounmpo, who continues to put together an All-Star-caliber season. The Greek Freak scored a game - high 34 points on top of 12 rebounds, five assists, five steals and two blocked shots. Fellow young star Jabari Parker posted 18 points of his own, while Michael Beasley had one of his best performances of the season off the bench, scoring 17 points. As a team, the Bucks put together one of their best shooting nights of the year, as they shot an astounding 54 percent from the floor. For the Cavaliers, it was one of their more uninspiring performances of the season, as they lacked much energy and settled for a lot of 3 - point shots. As a team, 39 of their 75 shots came from behind the arc. LeBron James led the way with 22 points, four rebounds and four assists, while Kyrie Irving added 20 points. Kevin Love was the only other Cavalier to score in double figures, as he posted a double - double of 13 points and 13 rebounds. Cleveland had won four in a row and seven of their last eight before Tuesday night, however, and still sit comfortable as the top team in the Eastern Conference.

6,6,"The second - seed Cleveland Cavaliers (40) completed their sweep of the seventh - seed Boston Celtics (0 - 4) in a 101 - 93 slugfest Sunday. Cleveland came out with purpose in the first half, wining both of the first two quarters to go into the break with 57 - 36 lead. Coach David Blatt could have taken the game easy with the Cavs up 30 in the series, but he opted to push the accelerator to the floor and used his big guns for most of the game to ensure a win and an end to the Cavs' first - round series. LeBron James played a team - high 46 minutes and was followed closely by Kyrie Irving with 43 minutes of his own. Kevin Love was forced from the game in the first quarter with what appeared to be a dislocated left shoulder after Celtics big man Kelly Olynyk appeared to pull down on Love's arm while fighting for a rebound. Love was n't the only player to be forced from the game, and the Love/Olynyk incident was n't the only physical altercation. In the second quarter, Kendrick Perkins put a hard screen on Jae Crowder, pushing Crowder in his face and forcing him to the ground before antagonizing Crowder with a tap to the face with a closed fist. Both Perkins and Crowder were assessed technical fouls, and Perkins earned a flagrant - 1 foul for the tap to Crowder's face. Shortly after halftime, Crowder was hit in the face by a backhand from J.R. Smith. Smith was given a flagrant - 2 and automatically ejected from the game as a result. Crowder injured his knee during the Smith incident and left the game with a left knee sprain, unable to return. The Celtics made a run in the third quarter, outscoring the Cavs 25 - 13 in the third window, but it was n't enough. Cleveland carried a nine - point lead into the fourth quarter and never let Boston get closer than a six - point divide at 99 - 93 with under a minute left in the game. The Cavaliers will advance to the Eastern Conference semifinals, and they'll play the winner of the Bulls/Bucks series that is currently at 3 - 1 with the Bulls holding the advantage. Kevin Love's status will be updated after he gets back to Cleveland and undergoes tests with the team's doctors. Smith and Perkins appear in line for suspensions, and a judgment on their statuses will likely be handed down before the start of the conference semifinals.

He did n't shoot all that well from the field (4 - 11 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt), but he was able to get to the free throw line 11 times and converted on eight of those attempts. Rookie Jabari Parker was the other starter to reach double - digits in points. He finished 7 - for - 13 from the field to score 15 points, marking his second straight night totaling 15 points.
