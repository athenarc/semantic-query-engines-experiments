1,1,"The Milwaukee Bucks (18 - 17) defeated the New York Knicks (5 - 31) 95 - 82 on Sunday at Madison Square Garden in New York.

The Bucks showed superior shooting, going 46 percent from the field, while the Knicks went only 41 percent from the floor. The Bucks also out - rebounded the Knicks 48 - 36, giving them in an even further advantage which helped them secure the 13 - point victory on the road.

He's now averaging 21 points per game over his last three games, as he's consistently been the offensive leader for this team. Zaza Pachulia also had a strong showing, finishing with 16 points (6 - 12 FG, 4 - 4 FT) and a team - high of 14 rebounds. It marked his second double - double in a row and fourth on the season, as the inexperienced centers on the Knicks' roster were n't able to limit him. Notching a double - double of his own, Giannis Antetokounmpo recorded 16 points (6 - 9 FG, 1 - 1 3Pt, 3 - 6 FT) and 12 rebounds. The 12 rebounds matched a season - high, while it was his second double - double of the season. Coming off the bench for a big night was Kendall Marshall. He went 6 - for - 8 from the field and 3 - for - 3 from the free throw line to score 15 points in 20 minutes. The Knicks really struggled to score without Carmelo Anthony and Amare Stoudemire. Tim Hardaway Jr led the team as the starting shooting guard, going 6 - for - 13 from the field and 3 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score 17 points, while also adding four assists. He's now scored 17 or more points in three out of his last four games, as he has put it on himself to pick up the slack with other key players sitting out. J.R. Smith also put together a solid outing as a starter. He finished with 15 points and seven rebounds in 37 minutes. Like Haradaway Jr, he's also benefitted from other guys sitting out, and has now combined for 37 points over his last two games. While he did n't have his best night defensively, Cole Aldrich scored 12 points (6 - 10 FG) and grabbed seven rebounds in 19 minutes. The only other Knick to reach double figures in points was Jason Smith, who came off the bench for 10 points (3 - 11 FG, 4 - 4 FT).

3,3,"The Toronto Raptors (29 - 15) defeated the Detroit Pistons (17 - 28) 114 - 110 on Sunday at the Air Canada Center in Toronto. Despite being out - scored 31 - 25 in the final quarter, the Raptors were able to hold of the Pistons' late comeback attempt and secure the four - point victory in front of their home crowd. While the game may have been close, the Raptors shot the ball much better than the Pistons, going 53 percent from the field compared to just 46 percent from the field for the Pistons. The Raptors also forced them into 14 turnovers, while only committing eight of their own, which may have made a big difference in this one. After combining for only 14 points over his last three games, DeMar DeRozan returned to form Sunday, finishing with 25 points (8 - 14 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt, 8 - 10 FT), six rebounds and four assists. It was good to see him turn things around, as the Raptors really needed him to play well after losing six of their last ten games. Jonas Valnciunas was another big factor in the win. He went 9 - for - 15 from the field and 2 - for - 2 from the free throw line to score 20 points, while adding 11 rebounds and three blocked shots as well. He's now recorded a double - double in three out of his last four games, while also notching three blocks in two consecutive outings. Amir Johnson had a solid showing as well, finishing with an efficient 17 points (7 - 9 FG, 3 - 4 FT) and two rebounds. He only played 17 minutes in Friday's win over the Sixers, but he was back to a normal amount of minutes Sunday, playing a full game's worth of 28. Both Greivis Vasquez and Louis Williams reached double figures in points as well, with 13 and 12 points respectively. With Brandon Jennings going down for the year, D.J. Augustin stepped up in a big way, going 12 - for - 20 from the field and 5 - for - 9 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 35 points, while adding eight assists as well. It was the most shots he's taken all season, resulting in a new season - high in points. He'll run as the starting point guard moving forward. Greg Monroe had another strong stat line Sunday, recording 21 points (9 - 17 FG, 3 - 5 FT) and 16 rebounds. He's now posted a double - double in four out of his last five games. Andre Drummond nearly notched a double - double of his own, but came up just shy with 14 points (7 - 11 FG, 0 - 1 FT) and eight rebounds. He had a really tough matchup with Valanciunas, so he did n't have his normal eye - popping amount of rebounds that he's come accustomed to. The only other Piston to reach double figures in points was Kentavious Caldwell-Pope who added 16 points (6 - 17 FG, 3 - 9 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT), three rebounds and two steals. The Raptors' next game will be on the road against the Indiana Pacers on Tuesday, while the Pistons will be at home against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Tuesday.

4,4,"The Detroit Pistons (30 - 29) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks (24 - 35) 102 - 91 on Saturday. In a battle of Eastern Conference Central Division rivals, the Pistons used timely three - point shooting and defense to gain an early advantage that they would n't relinquish. Even though Milwaukee outperformed them from beyond the arc by a margin of 58 percent to 40 percent, Detroit was able to nail six of their first seven three - point attempts, and 11 of their 19 overall in the first half. Their defense also elicited 21 turnovers from the Bucks, which they were able to convert into 23 points. On the offensive side, a strong outing from Reggie Jackson and Andre Drummond's league - leading 50th double - double on the season helped lead the way for the visitors, carrying them to the road victory. Jackson paced the Pistons' attack with 22 points, eight assists, two rebounds and two steals. Marcus Morris followed with 20 points, eight rebounds and two assists. Tobias Harris and Drummond were next with a pair of 15 - point efforts. The former added four rebounds, four assists and a steal, while the latter hauled in 17 boards, dished out two assists, recorded four steals and registered a pair of blocks.

5,5,"The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 118 - 101 Tuesday at BMO Harris Bradley Center. The Bucks (8 - 8) took advantage of a Cavaliers (13 - 3) team that looked disinterested from the second quarter on, as Milwaukee managed to open up a four - point lead at halftime and won the game with the help of a dominant third quarter, which they won 34 - 20. It got so out of hand in the third period that Cleveland head coach Tyronn Lue pulled all five of his starters who were on the court. The Bucks were led by Giannis Antetokounmpo, who continues to put together an All-Star-caliber season. The Greek Freak scored a game - high 34 points on top of 12 rebounds, five assists, five steals and two blocked shots. Fellow young star Jabari Parker posted 18 points of his own, while Michael Beasley had one of his best performances of the season off the bench, scoring 17 points. As a team, the Bucks put together one of their best shooting nights of the year, as they shot an astounding 54 percent from the floor. For the Cavaliers, it was one of their more uninspiring performances of the season, as they lacked much energy and settled for a lot of 3 - point shots. As a team, 39 of their 75 shots came from behind the arc. LeBron James led the way with 22 points, four rebounds and four assists, while Kyrie Irving added 20 points. Kevin Love was the only other Cavalier to score in double figures, as he posted a double - double of 13 points and 13 rebounds. Cleveland had won four in a row and seven of their last eight before Tuesday night, however, and still sit comfortable as the top team in the Eastern Conference. Up next, the Bucks will head to Brooklyn on Thursday to take on the Nets, while the Cavaliers will go home Thursday and play the Clippers.

6,6,"The second - seed Cleveland Cavaliers (40) completed their sweep of the seventh - seed Boston Celtics (0 - 4) in a 101 - 93 slugfest Sunday. Cleveland came out with purpose in the first half, wining both of the first two quarters to go into the break with 57 - 36 lead. Coach David Blatt could have taken the game easy with the Cavs up 30 in the series, but he opted to push the accelerator to the floor and used his big guns for most of the game to ensure a win and an end to the Cavs' first - round series. LeBron James played a team - high 46 minutes and was followed closely by Kyrie Irving with 43 minutes of his own. Kevin Love was forced from the game in the first quarter with what appeared to be a dislocated left shoulder after Celtics big man Kelly Olynyk appeared to pull down on Love's arm while fighting for a rebound. Love was n't the only player to be forced from the game, and the Love/Olynyk incident was n't the only physical altercation. In the second quarter, Kendrick Perkins put a hard screen on Jae Crowder, pushing Crowder in his face and forcing him to the ground before antagonizing Crowder with a tap to the face with a closed fist. Both Perkins and Crowder were assessed technical fouls, and Perkins earned a flagrant - 1 foul for the tap to Crowder's face. Shortly after halftime, Crowder was hit in the face by a backhand from J.R. Smith. Smith was given a flagrant - 2 and automatically ejected from the game as a result. Crowder injured his knee during the Smith incident and left the game with a left knee sprain, unable to return. The Celtics made a run in the third quarter, outscoring the Cavs 25 - 13 in the third window, but it was n't enough. Cleveland carried a nine - point lead into the fourth quarter and never let Boston get closer than a six - point divide at 99 - 93 with under a minute left in the game. The Cavaliers will advance to the Eastern Conference semifinals, and they'll play the winner of the Bulls/Bucks series that is currently at 3 - 1 with the Bulls holding the advantage. Kevin Love's status will be updated after he gets back to Cleveland and undergoes tests with the team's doctors. Smith and Perkins appear in line for suspensions, and a judgment on their statuses will likely be handed down before the start of the conference semifinals.

The Thunder took advantage of their superior shooting in this one. They shot 50 percent from the field, compared to the Bucks who shot only 41 percent from the field. Despite turning the ball over 20 times, the Thunder were also able to out - rebound the Bucks 54 - 31, giving them enough of an advantage to sneak out the victory at home on Tuesday. The Thunder are thrilled to have both of their superstars back from injury as both Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook led the Thunder to the victory in this one. Westbrook had a team - high of 28 points (8 - 16 FG, 0 - 2 3Pt), while also handing out seven assists. He was able to get to the line at will, and converted on 12 - of - 15 attempts. He's now scored over 20 points in seven out of the eight games he's played this season, recording season averages of 24 points and 7 assists per game. Durant on the other hand shot 7 - for - 11 from the field, but only 1 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score 23 points. He went a perfect 8 - for - 8 from the free throw line and came close to a triple - double with nine rebounds and seven assists. The rebounds and assists were season - highs for Durant. Serge Ibaka had a solid all - around game in the victory as he went a perfect 5 - for - 5 from the field to score 15 points. Reggie Jackson supplied the Thunder with an effective bench presence as well with 18 points and seven rebounds. O.J. Mayo was the leading scorer on the other side for the Bucks, as he shot 6 - for - 13 from the field, but only 0 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score a team - high of 18 points. He eventually had to leave the game though, as he fouled out before the end of regulation. Giannis Antetokounmpo was also able to reach double figures with 17 points and seven rebounds. He did n't shoot all that well from the field (4 - 11 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt), but he was able to get to the free throw line 11 times and converted on eight of those attempts.

The game was largely a tale of two halves, with New York dominating the first two quarters despite missing two starters on offense, and jumping out to a 46 - 35 lead by intermission. However, the Lakers battled back through the final two periods, and the two teams found themselves knotted at 87 with 29 seconds left. Neither club could find a way to break the tie over the ensuing 28 ticks of the clock, with Kobe Bryant failing to hit a 12 - foot jumper for the Lakers after a 19 - second possession. Carmelo Anthony hauled in the defensive rebound off the missed shot, and following a Knicks timeout, Jose Calderon sealed the victory with a clutch 26 - foot three - point jumper with less than a second remaining. Anthony led the way for the Knicks with a 26 - point, 12 - rebound double - double, to which he added four assists and a block.

It was n't the cleanest game ever played, with the Timberwolves handing out 23 turnovers and the Grizzlies racking up 17 of their own, but it was still a tight matchup that ended with a close finish. Marc Gasol put the Grizzlies on his back and helped the Grizzlies get their first victory of the year. Gasol finished the game with 32 points (12 - 17 FG), nine rebounds, three assists, two steals, and two blocked shots, getting a little bit of everything on the stat sheet Wednesday.

The other starting guard, Courtney Lee, shot 5 - for - 11 from the field and 2 - for - 4 from behind the arc to score 14 points in 35 minutes of action. Despite the win, the Grizzlies got little output from their bench unit, who only scored 10 of their 105 total points. With a ton of fresh faces, this was finally a shot for Timberwolves' fans to see their new young lineup. Thaddeus Young was very efficient in his debut, scoring 26 points (10 - 18 FG, 2 - 3 3PT, 4 - 4 FT) and grabbing four rebounds, four assists, and two steals.

Brook Lopez once again led the way for the Nets, as he continues to play his best basketball of the season. He had 26 points (12 - 22 FG) and nine rebounds, and in his last five games is averaging 25 points and 10 rebounds in his last five games.

Jarrett Jack (14) and Thaddeus Young (10) were the only other Brooklyn players to score in double figures, and while he did not reach double figure scoring, Deron Williams still put together a solid stat line of nine points (3 - 11 FG, 2 - 4 3Pt), nine assists and seven rebounds in 31 minutes. The win, along with a Celtics win, leaves the Nets in a tie for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference, but they are losing the tiebreaker to Boston. They currently hold a 2 - game lead over the Pacers for that position with just three games left to play in the regular season. The Wizards rested John Wall for the second night in a row, as they do not have much to play for as the season winds down.

Washington ended a short, but important two game losing skid with an easy victory on the road, and are now 3 games back of the Detroit Pistons for the 8 - seed in the Eastern Conference. The Wizards played at a high speed pace, led by John Wall, who diced through the Lakers defense and took advantage of his matchup with D’Angelo Russell. Wall’s 22 points, 13 assists and five rebounds overshadowed his seven turnovers, which proved to be a non - issue seeing the double digit lead his team held for most of the game. The former No. 1 overall pick ran impressive sets with Marcin Gortat, who was on the receiving end of multiple flashy dimes, and turned in 16 points and 10 rebounds. The Lakers got into early foul trouble and ended up with a total of 26 team fouls, but the Wizards shot a poor 16 - of - 29 from the free throw line. Given the amount of times that Los Angeles put Washington on the line, the 13 points loss could well have been a 20 - plus point blowout. D’Angelo Russell was no match defending Wall from getting to the rim, but he did equal his opponents scoring with 22 points of his own. Kobe Bryant has a handful of games left in his career, and the wear and tear of his 20th season reared it’s head a few times during the game. Bryant finished with 17 points, one rebound and two assists on 6 - of - 15 shooting, but also looked sloppy handling the ball at times, which he even recognized after checking himself out of the game.

Both teams had locked up their playoff spots before this game, but we now know for sure who each will play. The Wizards will take on the Toronto Raptors in the first round, while the Cavaliers will play the Boston Celtics. With LeBron James being held out of the lineup and the usual starters getting very limited minutes, it was the bench that took over this game for the Cavaliers.

Dellavedova, on the other hand, went 6 - for - 11 from the floor and 4 - for - 5 from deep to score 18 points, to go along with 12 assists and two steals. The double - double was the first for Dellavedova on the year, while both his point and assist totals were season - highs as well. Tristan Thompson was the other bench player to reach double figures. In 21 minutes, he finished with 12 points (4 - 7 FG, 4 - 4 FT) and eight rebounds, boosting his April averages to 7 points and 8 rebounds per game over 23 minutes. Playing just 18 minutes with the starters, Kevin Love was still very efficient with his time and chipped in with 19 points (6 - 12 FG, 5 - 6 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and three rebounds before getting most of the night off for rest. Like the Cavaliers, the Wizards rested the majority of their players, as John Wall, Bradley Beal and Paul Pierce were all held out of this matchup. It was Martell Webster who had the biggest outing, as he came off the bench for 20 points (5 - 9 FG, 3 - 5 3Pt, 7 - 8 FT) and three rebounds over 36 minutes. The 20 points were a new season - high for the forward, as he had yet to break double figures in points during this season. Rasual Butler was another reason the Wizards were able to keep this game close. He finished with 17 points (7 - 19 FG, 3 - 8 3Pt), seven rebounds and two steals, while playing 45 minutes. It was a nice end to the season for Butler, who finishes the year with averages of 8 points and 3 rebounds over 74 games. Both Kevin Seraphin and Ramon Sessions reached double figures in points as well. Seraphin recorded 12 points (6 - 13 FG, 0 - 1 FT), 12 rebounds and three blocked shots, while Sessions added 14 points (4 - 8 FG, 2 - 2 3Pt, 4 - 6 FT) and six assists. This marks the final regular season game for both teams, but each will head into the playoffs which start this weekend.

16,16,"The Los Angeles Lakers (5 - 23) defeated the Denver Nuggets (11 - 17) 111 - 107 on Tuesday night. The game was a tale of two halves, as these teams showed why they have struggled so much this season. The Nuggets scored 64 points in the first half to take a 13 - point lead, but blew it in the second half with some bad defense. The Lakers outscored Denver 32 - 16 in the third quarter and went to Kobe Bryant to close things out at the end. Denver made some crucial errors late and it really hurt them in a game they really should have won. It was a vintage Kobe performance, as he carried the Lakers to a much needed win. He matched his season - high with 31 points and hit multiple baskets late to seal the victory. Jordan Clarkson and Lou Williams both played good as well, as they scored 36 points combined. The offense has been terrible all season, for the Lakers, but this 111 - spot will hopefully get them going. Their next game will be on Christmas, when they take on the Los Angeles Clippers. The Nuggets had a season - high 21 - point lead in the second quarter, but managed to choke that away. They let the Lakers go on a 23 - 3 run between the second and third quarter and could never recover after that. Will Barton scored 18 points in the first quarter, but really struggled after that, finishing with 25 in the game. The one bright spot was the bench, as all four players who came off the bench scored at least nine points while accumulating 58 points all together. Denver also played this game without Danilo Gallinari and that might have been the key in the loss with no go - to weapon at the end of the game. This was a brutal loss for Nuggets fans and they'll look to bounce - back on Wednesday when they take on the Phoenix Suns.

17,17,"The visiting Dallas Mavericks took down the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday, 108 - 104. Dallas (20 - 30) has picked up steam in recent weeks after what was an abysmal start to the season. Friday's victory was marked by a breakout performance from D-League call - up Yogi Ferrell. Ferrell, who shot an astounding 9 - of - 11 from three - point range, scored a career - high 32 points to lead the Mavericks including a game - clinching three - pointer with under 30 seconds remaining. While Ferrell dropped jaws with his impressive play, wing Wesley Matthews also put together a stellar performance, scoring 27 points and coming away with six rebounds. As a whole, the team earned the win on the backs of strong three - point shooting. The Mavs shot an impressive 17 - of - 31 from beyond the arc. Portland (22 - 29), meanwhile, was let down by star point guard Damian Lillard. Lillard shot just 4 - of - 20 on the night in quite possibly his worst outing of the season. On the other hand, wing Evan Turner steped up for one of his best performances as a Blazer. Turner scored 24 points on 10 - of - 17 shooting. The Blazers held a rare advantage in the rebounding column, but were unable to shoot with nearly the efficiency of Dallas, ultimately ending in the loss. The Blazers will visit OKC on Sunday, while the Mavericks will visit Denver on Monday.
