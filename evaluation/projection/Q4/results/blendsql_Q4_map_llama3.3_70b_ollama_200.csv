3. **Format the Birthdate**: Once you have the birthdates, you would need to format them as DD/MM/YYYY. The exact method for this depends on your database system and programming language. For example, in MySQL, you could use the `DATE_FORMAT` function:

    ```sql
    SELECT DATE_FORMAT(birthdate, '%d/%m/%Y') 
    FROM Players 
    WHERE player_name IN ('Elijah Millsap', 'Emmanuel Mudiay', 'Eric Bledsoe', 'Eric Gordon', 'Erick Green')"

178,Elijah Millsap,"To answer this question, I would need access to the actual database or a list of birthdates for the players. Since that information is not provided here, I'll guide you through how one might approach this task if they had access to such data.

1. **Access the Database**: First, you would need to connect to your database using SQL or another database query language.

2. **Query the Database**: You would then write a query to select the birthdate for each player from your ""Players"" table. Assuming the birthdate column is named ""birthdate"" and it's in a format that your database can understand (like YYYY-MM-DD), your query might look something like this:

    ```sql
    SELECT birthdate 
    FROM Players 
    WHERE player_name IN ('Elijah Millsap', 'Emmanuel Mudiay', 'Eric Bledsoe', 'Eric Gordon', 'Erick Green')"

Please note that these dates might not be accurate or up-to-date. The actual birthdates can be verified through official sources, such as the players' official social media profiles, team websites, or reputable sports databases.


Also, please note that the format of the answer is DD/MM/YYYY as requested."

185,Beno Udrih,"To answer this question, I would need access to a database containing the birthdates of basketball players. Since I don't have direct access to such databases, I'll provide an example based on publicly available information up to my last update in 2023.

Given the names:
1. Beno Udrih
2. Blake Griffin
3. Brandan Wright
4. Brandon Jennings
5. Brian Roberts

Their respective birthdates are (in DD/MM/YYYY format, based on public data):
- Beno Udrih: 05/07/1982
- Blake Griffin: 16/03/1989
- Brandan Wright: 05/10/1987
- Brandon Jennings: 23/09/1989
- Brian Roberts: 12/03/1985 (Note: There might be multiple individuals with this name, but based on a well-known basketball player by this name)

Answer: 05/07/1982"

196,Jeremy Lin,"To answer this question, I would need access to a database containing the birthdates of basketball players. Since I don't have direct access to such databases, I'll provide a general approach on how one might solve this using hypothetical data.

Assuming there's a table named ""Players"" with columns for ""player_name"" and ""birthdate"", you could query this information directly from the database. However, without actual database access or specific birthdate information for these players, I can only demonstrate the logic:

1. Connect to the database.
2. Query the ""Players"" table for the ""birthdate"" where ""player_name"" matches each of the given names.
3. Format the retrieved birthdates into ""DD/MM/YYYY"" format.

Given the lack of specific data and direct database access, let's proceed with known information about these players' birthdates (which might not be up-to-date or accurate without current database access):

- Jeff Ayres: April 29, 1987
- Jeff Taylor: May 23, 1989
- Jeremy Lin: August 23, 1988
- Jerian Grant: October 9, 1992
- Jodie Meeks: August 21, 1987

Thus, the formatted answer would be:
29/04/1987"
