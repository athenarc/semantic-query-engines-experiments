82,Alan Anderson,"To answer this question, I would need access to a database containing information about the players, including their birthdates. Since I don't have direct access to such databases, I'll provide a general approach on how one might solve this problem with hypothetical data.

Let's assume we have a table named ""Players"" with columns for ""player_name"" and ""birthdate"". The ""birthdate"" column would contain dates in a format that can be easily converted or is already in the desired format (DD/MM/YYYY).

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Query the Database**: You would query the database to select the birthdate for each player based on their name.

2. **Format the Birthdate**: Ensure the birthdate is in the DD/MM/YYYY format. If it's not, you would need to convert it. The method of conversion depends on the database system being used (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server).

3. **Output the Birthdates**: Once you have the birthdates for each player in the correct format, you can output them separated by semicolons.

Given the names:
- Alan Anderson
- Blake Griffin
- Brandon Jennings
- Briante Weber
- Brook Lopez

And assuming their respective birthdates are (note: these dates might not be accurate as they are used only for demonstration purposes):
- Alan Anderson: 1982-03-16
- Blake Griffin: 1989-03-16
- Brandon Jennings: 1989-09-23
- Briante Weber: 1992-12-29
- Brook Lopez: 1988-04-01

Please note that these dates are fictional and used only for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, you would need to replace them with the actual birthdates of the players.


To achieve this in a programming language like Python, using a library such as pandas for data manipulation and assuming you have a DataFrame `df` with player names and their corresponding birthdates, you could do something like this:


```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample DataFrame (replace with actual database query)
data = {
    ""player_name"": [""Isaiah Canaan"", ""J.J. Barea"", ""Jarell Eddie"", ""Jason Terry"", ""Jeff Taylor""],
    ""birthdate"": [""1991-05-09"", ""1984-06-26"", ""1991-10-30"", ""1977-09-15"", ""1989-04-23""]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Convert birthdate to datetime and then format it as DD/MM/YYYY
df['birthdate'] = pd.to_datetime(df['birthdate']).dt.strftime('%d/%m/%Y')

# Create a list of formatted birthdates for the given player names
player_names = [""Isaiah Canaan"", ""J.J. Barea"", ""Jarell Eddie"", ""Jason Terry"", ""Jeff Taylor""]
birthdates = [df.loc[df['player_name'] == name, 'birthdate'].values[0] if name in df['player_name'].values else '' for name in player_names]

# Join the birthdates into a single string separated by '"
