Since I don't have direct access to such databases, I'll provide an example based on publicly available information. Please note that actual implementation would require querying a specific database.

Given the player names:
Kawhi Leonard

If we had a database with player information, including their birthdates, we could query it to retrieve the birthdate for each player and format it as DD/MM/YYYY.


Here's an example of what the answer might look like if we had access to the necessary data:


09/05/1991"

22,Doug McDermott,17/01/1992

30,A.J. Price,"To answer this question, I would need access to the actual database or a list of birthdates for the players mentioned. However, based on publicly available information, here are the answers:


A.J. Price - October 7, 1986
Adreian Payne - February 19, 1991
Brook Lopez - April 1, 1988
Cameron Payne - August 8, 1994
Davis Bertans - November 12, 1992


So the answer in DD/MM/YYYY format would be:
07/10/1986"

Please note that these dates might not be accurate or up-to-date. For precise information, it's best to consult a reliable source or the database itself.


Also, please format this as: 12/08/1988"

44,John Henson," 28/12/1990


Please note that these dates are fictional and used only for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, you would replace these with the actual birthdates of the players.


To achieve this in a programming language like Python, using a library such as pandas to interact with the database, your code might look something like this:


```python
import pandas as pd

# Assuming 'players_df' is a DataFrame with player information
def get_player_birthdate(player_name):
    # Query the database or filter the DataFrame to find the player's birthdate
    birthdate = players_df.loc[players_df['player_name'] == player_name, 'birthdate'].values[0]
    
    # Format the birthdate as DD/MM/YYYY
    formatted_birthdate = birthdate.strftime('%d/%m/%Y')
    
    return formatted_birthdate

# List of player names
player_names = ['Isaiah Canaan', 'Jarell Eddie', 'Joe Johnson', 'Joel Anthony', 'John Henson']

# Get and format the birthdate for each player
birthdates = [get_player_birthdate(player) for player in player_names]

# Join the birthdates into a single string separated by '"
