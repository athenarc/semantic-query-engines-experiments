34,Omer Asik,
35,Kawhi Leonard,"This question requires external knowledge (birthdates of players) to answer. Since I don't have access to that information, I cannot provide a valid answer.  I would need a data source containing player names and their corresponding birthdates.

If you provide the birthdates, I can format them as requested.  For example, if you provided:

Kawhi Leonard: 1991-07-29
Kendall Marshall: 1991-11-14
Kevin Martin: 1980-05-04
Marc Gasol: 1985-01-29
Marquese Chriss: 1996-11-23

Then my answer would be:

29/07/1991"
