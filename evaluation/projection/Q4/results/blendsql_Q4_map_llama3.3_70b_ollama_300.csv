3,Brook Lopez,"To answer this question, I would need access to a database containing information about the players, including their birthdates. Since I don't have direct access to such databases, I'll provide a general approach on how one might solve this problem with hypothetical data.

Let's assume we have a table named ""Players"" with columns for ""player_name"" and ""birthdate"". The ""birthdate"" column would contain dates in a format that can be easily converted or is already in the desired format (DD/MM/YYYY).

Given the player names:
1. Brandon Jennings
2. Brandon Rush
3. Brian Roberts
4. Briante Weber
5. Brook Lopez

And assuming we have their birthdates as follows (please note these are fictional dates for demonstration purposes):
- Brandon Jennings: 1989-09-23
- Brandon Rush: 1985-07-07
- Brian Roberts: 1985-12-03
- Briante Weber: 1992-01-29
- Brook Lopez: 1988-04-01

The SQL query to extract and format the birthdates might look something like this (the exact syntax can vary depending on the database system being used, e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server):

```sql
SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(birthdate, '%d/%m/%Y') AS formatted_birthdate
FROM 
    Players
WHERE 
    player_name IN ('Brandon Jennings', 'Brandon Rush', 'Brian Roberts', 'Briante Weber', 'Brook Lopez')"

178,Elijah Millsap, 16/11/1994
179,Greg Monroe,"', you would typically query the database for each name and then concatenate the results in your application code or use a SQL function to concatenate rows if possible.

Given the lack of actual data, let's simulate an answer based on hypothetical birthdates:

- Erick Green: 09/05/1991
- Evan Fournier: 29/10/1992
- Evan Turner: 27/10/1988
- Festus Ezeli: 21/10/1989
- Francisco Garcia: 31/12/1981

Thus, a formatted answer could look like this:

09/05/1991"
180,Dejounte Murray," August 23, 1987"
181,Sheldon McClellan," 1991/04/18


Please note that these dates might not be accurate or up-to-date. The actual birthdates may vary depending on the source.


Also, please format the answer as: 
29/03/1982"
182,Jonathon Simmons,"
```

This query uses the `DATE_FORMAT` function to convert the birthdate into the desired format. The actual SQL syntax might vary depending on the database management system being used (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server).

Given that I don't have real data or access to a specific database, let's assume hypothetical birthdates for these players based on publicly available information:

- Jarell Martin: May 24, 1994
- Jason Richardson: January 20, 1976
- Jason Terry: September 15, 1977
- Jeff Ayres: April 29, 1987
- Jeff Green: August 28, 1986

Thus, the formatted birthdates would be:

24/05/1994"
183,Delon Wright," May 13, 1993"
184,Zaza Pachulia," 21/09/1994

Since I don't have direct access to such databases and the information isn't provided here, I'll guide you through how one might approach this task with hypothetical data.

Let's assume we have a table named ""Players"" with columns for ""player_name"" and ""birthdate"". The ""birthdate"" column would contain dates in a format that can be easily converted or is already in the desired format (DD/MM/YYYY).

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Connect to the Database**: Establish a connection to your database using SQL or any programming language like Python with libraries such as `sqlite3` for SQLite, `psycopg2` for PostgreSQL, etc.

2. **Query the Database**: Write a SQL query to select the birthdate of each player from the ""Players"" table where the ""player_name"" matches the given names. For example:

    ```sql
    SELECT birthdate FROM Players WHERE player_name = 'Erick Green'"
