16,A.J. Price,"To determine the nationality of each player based on their names, we'll have to make some educated guesses, as the nationality might not be directly inferable from the name alone. However, certain names or parts of names can give clues about a person's origin or nationality. Here are the attempts for each player:

1. A.J. Price - American
2. Al-Farouq Aminu - Nigerian (Al-Farouq is a common Muslim name, and Aminu is a surname found in several African countries, but given the full context of his career and publicly available information, he is of Nigerian descent.)
3. Alan Anderson - American
4. Brandon Jennings - American
5. Briante Weber - American

So, the answer based on these educated guesses would be:
American"
17,Sebastian Telfair,American
18,Francisco Garcia,"To determine the nationality of each player based on their names, we'll have to make some educated guesses, as the names alone do not always definitively indicate a person's nationality. However, based on common naming conventions and the popularity of certain names in different countries, we can attempt to infer the likely nationality for each player:

1. **Francisco Garcia** - Given the first name ""Francisco,"" which is very common in Spanish-speaking countries, it's reasonable to guess that Francisco Garcia is likely from a country where Spanish is an official language, such as Spain or many countries in Central and South America. However, without more specific information, we can't pinpoint the exact nationality, but for simplicity, let's associate ""Francisco"" with a Hispanic background.

2. **Glen Davis** - The name ""Glen Davis"" sounds typically American, given the first name ""Glen,"" which is common in English-speaking countries, particularly in the United States.

3. **Grant Jerrett** - Similar to Glen Davis, ""Grant Jerrett"" also has a name that is commonly found in English-speaking countries, suggesting he might be American or from another country with significant English influence.

4. **Hollis Thompson** - Again, ""Hollis Thompson"" has a name profile that fits well within the United States or other English-speaking nations.

5. **J.J. Barea** - The surname ""Barea"" and the initials ""J.J."" could suggest a variety of nationalities, but given the context of basketball and considering international players in the NBA, José Juan ""J.J."" Barea is known to be from Puerto Rico.

Given these considerations:

- Francisco Garcia: Hispanic (for simplicity, let's say Spanish or Mexican, acknowledging this is an oversimplification)
- Glen Davis: American
- Grant Jerrett: American
- Hollis Thompson: American
- J.J. Barea: Puerto Rican

So, the answer based on likely nationalities inferred from names would be:
Spanish/Mexican"
